## OverView
A Medical diagnosis program made to take a patient with blood test results and give medical diagnosis according to the blood test results, application was built for **EDUCATIONAL** purposes only and not something to work by.
##### The program was built using Java and JavaFx Script and SceneBuilder.
The program saves the user credentials into CSV data files (Excel) and saves the blood test results and the overall diagnosis into seperate files containing the patient's info alongside his personal results.
the blood test results can be inserted manually or dragged and dropped from the desktop or just imported from the pc itself, in addition the final blood test results diagnosis can be exported and viewed on the desktop.
the program works by a set of rules that were given in a lecture in order to measure if the level is in the average scale or not, before giving out the diagnosis the program will have a window in which it will ask the user if s/he wants to answer few questions that might make the diagnosis answer more precise in order to ensure better treatment decisions.
